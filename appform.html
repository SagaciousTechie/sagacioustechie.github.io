          <p class="lead">
          For more information and to register, please email <b>faculty.resources@amphsonline.org</b> indicating your interest for the specific session of the Clinical Practice Training Program. Please include the appropriate Course Code (see page 6) in the subject line. Attach the following in your email:</p>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>CV/Resume</li>
            <li>Completed Program Registration Form</li>
            <li>Current Official/Unofficial Transcript</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="lead">Please make note of the application deadlines for each session. We review applications in the order they are received; therefore, it is in your best interest to submit your completed application as early as possible. Once we develop a diverse pool of qualified candidates, we are no longer able to review further applications, especially those submitted after the deadline.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Enrollment <br></h2>
          <p class="lead">If you have been offered admissions into the program, you must submit an enrollment deposit of $300.00 to secure your seat according to the schedule on page 6. The deposit will be applied to your total fees due. You must then pay the balance of your program fees in full at a minimum of one week before the start of classes; otherwise, you will be un-enrolled in the program and you will forfeit your deposit.</p>

          <p class="lead">If you have been waitlisted, you will receive specific instructions on next steps. If we decide to institute a waitlist for any particular session, there is a very good chance we may open up another session or be able to accommodate waitlisted candidates in the confirmed sessions. Waitlisted candidates will be asked to submit a deposit of $225.00 to secure their seat. The deposit will be applied towards the total fees due when waitlisted candidates have been officially offered a seat in an available session. Should you not be offered a seat in an available session, your deposit will be returned to you along with your notification.</p>

Therefore, please ensure that should you be selected, you are fully committed to completing this training program prior to sending your application and deposit.</p>
