          of underprivileged communities in New York City. Named a <b>U.S. Top-Rated Nonprofit</b> out of
          1.8 million reviewed nonprofits in 2013 and ranked the <b>#2 Healthcare Organization</b> in Brooklyn,
          New York, we are a multidisciplinary clinical services and public health research organization that
          develops sustainable healthcare infrastructures for patients who have been turned away by
          hospitals and other providers. <b>We specifically take in patient cases that are particularly
          difficult to solve and work in a dynamic team environment to develop primary care

          <p class="lead">We all know that pursuing a career in medicine or public health requires an enormous investment of time, money, and preparation. In our experience, <b>undergraduate curricula do not provide an accurate representation of the intensity and rigor of medical school education</b>. To remedy this, we have crafted a unique 6-week intensive training and preparatory program for prospective medical, nursing, public health, and allied-health school students. <b>This course is designed to equip you with introductory clinical skills and offer concrete experience of what the field of medicine and public health is all about</b>.</p>

Health professions schools often do not provide training in public health and health policy, and <b>we aim to give our students valuable insight</b> into how public health frameworks affect clinical decision-making.</li>
            <li class="lead">Provide you with <b>professional-level certifications</b> that you can use to further your education, resume, and career, by boosting your credentials while partaking in a valuable educational experience over summer break or as an extracurricular during the school year.</li>
            <li class="lead">Provide you with the <b>foundations for critical thinking and analyses</b> in a clinical setting, and understand how various fields such as public health, policy, and research interact to deliver healthcare for patients.</li>

          contributed $1,247.00 to each accepted student’s cost of training. <b>You would only have
          to pay the applicable registration and certification process examination fees, which total
